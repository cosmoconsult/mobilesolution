# COSMO Mobile Solution

One of the major competitive advantages of medium-sized companies is speed and flexibility. These strengths are based on short and efficient information flows.

Flexible capture and real-time transfer of current data to the ERP system are essential for lean processes in the warehouse. With COSMO Mobile Solution for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, data is entered and viewed when it is needed, regardless of your location - directly at the point of origin. Handhelds, tablets with touchscreens or stationary screens are available as devices.

The capture of warehouse movements directly at the point of origin and the prompt transfer of the information to the ERP system maps the current situation in the warehouse. This means that downstream business processes, such as picking, have immediate access to this current data. Processes are significantly improved and made more secure with COSMO Mobile Solution.
